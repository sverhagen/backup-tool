Simple scripts to backup my computer

<hr/>

**What computer is this for?** &mdash; I'm a proud and stubborn Windows user, currently on Windows 7. Clearly that's the only environment that this is tested on.

**Then why is there BASH scripts?** &mdash; Windows Command Prompt is horror, [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/) rocks.

**Why does it fail without elevation?** &mdash; In order to pull stuff from the registry, it needs to be elevated (i.e. "Run As Administrator").

**Your seriously expect *takers* for this?** &mdash; No, I don't. This is for my own, personal use. With GitHub at least I have a backup of my backup tool.
